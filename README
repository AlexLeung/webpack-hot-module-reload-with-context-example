HMR is kinda finicky, and require.context is finicky as well. I usually start with a known working version and then turn that code step by step into the code that isn't working and then watch when it fails. Here's a working version for those of you that want to play around.

Here's a version that should be working:

run `npm install` and then `npm start`. Open localhost:8080/bundle in your browser. Open the console. Now edit or add files in the filesToLoad directory.
